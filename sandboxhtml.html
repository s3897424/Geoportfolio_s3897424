		This website is the geoportfolio of DITTO PIKACHU. The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of geospatial science
		<p>
		A brief introduction about myself is that I am born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and as of February 1996, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Science (Geospatial Science) (Honours) course. My geospatial-related interests is working with remote sensing data, collection and analysis of
		aerial-captured imagery, distribution modelling and creating 3D generations of models using spatial data. My current geospatial projects involve distribution 
		modelling of the flesh-footed shearwater bird species in the Recherche archipelago and assisting with the potential generation of a basic Digital Twin of
		Honiara using open-source data and programs.
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include travelling and collecting apples!

		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were two tests and a first practical (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practicals completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of three maps of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->
		<p>
			Below are the three maps that I have created as part of my course:

	<!--SUBJECT 2-->

	<div class="bar"><h2>Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you have done yourself-->
	<div class="paragraphs">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a unique but very practical and interesting subject done in both geospatial science and surveying. The subject uses 
		knowledge from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		For the 2019 version of the course which I completed, the assignment was about the proposal of creating an amphitheatre at Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The topographic survey map was created using surveying data obtained on the field using a total station at Deep Rock Oval, Yarra Bend Park.
			The topographic map was made using LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD. The 3D generated scene was created using the ArcGIS suite program ArcScene while the raw data was
			modified in ArcMap. The proposed pathway was created using ArcMap by using the GIS program to generate the pathway based on slope angle and the amphitheatre
			based on z-values. The final map used Adobe Illustrator to create the map along with ArcMap for exporting the 2D amphitheathre image and ArcScene for 
			exporting the image of the 3D scene.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2022) within the geospatial science industry. The two main companies that I have worked at 
		were AAM Group and Tetra Tech. This page will outline my experience gained and skills I have learned from working at AAM Group and Tetra Tech along with an
		overview of my current geospatial skillset.

	<div class="job-overview">
		My time at AAM Group was part of an internship for the thirty day work experience subject. The work experience subject taught me a lot about what industry
		standard work is done within the geospatial industry. I chose to work at AAM Group as I read about it online on how it is a large company that does a lot of
		geospatial activity and to my personal knowledge, is one of the few companies that specialise solely on different forms of geospatial work as their primary
		source of business compared to other companies that have a spatial team but the company itself does not specialise in geospatial work. The work at AAM Group in 
		the Melbourne office was less about performing geospatial analysis on pre-existing data, but rather capturing and collecting their own spatial data which 
		the mapping team process and edit into a usable form for the client.
		<p>
		As part of the mapping team, the work I was exposed to was editing and processing aerial imagery-based data. The work consisted of editing out distortions and 
		errors in the aerial imagery, manipulating colour bands of the orthomosaics to brighten or darken the imagery to the client's needs and creating Digital 
		Terrain Models from provided LIDAR captured imagery from elevation models. My work at AAM Group used less ArcGIS products than I initially believed, using
		other programs such as Global Mapper and AAM-exclusive products due to their Melbourne work being focused on aerial imagery rather than spatial data analysis.

	<div class="job-overview">
		My work at Tetra Tech as part of the spatial team involves using the ArcGIS suite for producing figures and maps for both internal staff members from other
		departments and entites from external companies. The work is primarily modifying and publishing maps based on the specifications outlined by the client, either
		editing the pre-existing data to be updated or creating new figures and information for visualisation on the maps. A lot of the work requires knowledge of
		programming languages such as Python, Visual Basic (VB) and SQL to assist with automating tasks and sorting through spatial databases and attribute tables. 
		<p>
		The work that I have done is not limited to spatial analysis. At one point, I was publishing raster datasets for Web GIS-use and another, I was checking off
		graphs to make sure that the graphs had all the data required on them, either adding the data onto the graph myself if the data is available or outlining the 
		graphs with the missing data for inspection by another staff member if I cannot add the data onto the graph myself.
