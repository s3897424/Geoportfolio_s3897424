		Hi, my name is Joel Edwards and I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Science (Surveying) (Honours) course at RMIT. 
		<p>
		My Surveying-related interests include photography, working with specialised surveying equipment (eg. total stations), Cadastral Surveying, and the surveying of the natural environment. 
		My current Surveying Capstone Project involves a deformation survey of Eildon Dam, where I am analysing the movement of the dam wall over time.
		</p>
		<p>
		I am currently working in Cadastral Surveying as a survey assistant and I am building towards becoming a party leader and ultimately a licensed surveyor once I complete my studies.

	<div class="paragraphs">
		Cadastral Survey Practice is a core subject in the surveying degree. The subject focuses on the area of Cadastral Surveying (land/property surveying) 
		and provides a basis for students to gain experience and understanding in the cadastral surveying industry.
		<p> 
		During this subject we gain skills in the following areas:
		<ul>
			<li>Reading and understanding survey plans eg. Plans of Subdivision</li>
			<li>The process of urban cadastral re-establishment</li>
			<li>The drawing of Abstract of Field Records</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		The subject consisted of 3 assignments, one practical component involving a re-establishment survey in Parkville,
		and two classroom tasks involving the design of a Plan of Subdivision and another re-establishment.
		The main deliverables of this subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Abstract of Field Records</li>
			<li>Licensed surveyor's report</li>
			<li>Survey field notes and worksheets</li>
			<li>Plan of Subdivision</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Abstract of Field Records and Plan of Subdivision below were created using the AutoCAD software.
			The surveying software LisCAD.SEE was also used in this course. 
			As these software programs are commonly used in the surveying industry, gaining experience in them has been very invaluable.

		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were two tests and a first practical (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practicals completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of three maps of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->
		<p>
			Below is two examples of the maps created in this subject, the first being the final Cartography map I created on the 
			Falls to Hotham Alpine Crossing and the second as part of practical 2:

	<div class="job-overview">
		I started work at A Line Surveying as a survey assistant on the 3rd of April 2023 and have worked in this role to date. A Line Surveying is a 
		medium sized specialist land surveying company with experience in the areas of Survey, Subdivisional Assessment, Land Management, and Town Planning. 
		The significance of this work is that it is in the area of surveying I am most interested in working as a career and is strongly correlated with my 
		studies in surveying. The knowledge and experience gained from this role already has been invaluable in my learning of cadastral surveying and as 
		I continue in this role I further develop my skills as a land surveyor. 
		<p>
			As a survey assistant, my experience is mostly in the field, where a field crew of two persons operate: the survey assistant and the party leader. 
			As the survey assistant my main role in the field consists of operating the total station. This involves the setting up of the instrument, 
			locating features at a job site via a prism pole under the party leader's instructions, locating features under own instruction with the 
			reflectorless function, the setting up and downloading of job files in the instrument, and overall maintenance of the instrument including 
			charging batteries and drying the instrument after use in wet conditions. A GNSS receiver is also used in the field, where the role of the 
			survey assistant is to operate the GNSS controller while the party leader uses the GNSS receiver. 
			<p>
			In the office my roles include making field files by compiling the resources needed for a job including resources such as plan of subdivisions, lot plans, and permanent survey mark sketches and the compiling of old job files to be scanned into the system. Experience in using LISCAD to draw up jobs has also recently started. 
			Jobs undertaken as a survey assistant include re-establishment surveys, feature and level surveys, as-built surveys, and updating of field records.
